This is a Research Project for ECE 570. This project involves integrating maximal neruon activation into a diffusion model.

Code from the following files were derived from this [repo](https://github.com/bot66/MNISTDiffusion) by bot66. This repo was used as the baseline diffusion model for this project.:

- `train_mnist.py`
- `unet.py`
- `utils.py`
- `model.py`
